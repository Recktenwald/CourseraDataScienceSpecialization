I think it is probably fine to take the ["I know it when I see it"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) approach.

One important part of data science is cleaning up messy data, i.e. make it palatable for humans. They give the example of genetic data, but that only looks messy to us because we are not ribosomes.
So we have to keep in mind the audiance. What 'clean' means will depend on the background knowledge of the person reading it. 

In the previous lection [[What is Data Science]] they also gave the [[Three Vs]] that characterize [[Big Data]].
